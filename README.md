# MobileNet Project

## Key Concepts Learned:
- **Batch Normalization**  
  A technique to normalize the inputs of each layer in the network, accelerating training and improving stability.

- **Normal CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**  
  Understanding the standard architecture of CNNs, which use convolutional layers to extract features from input images.

- **Transfer Learning**  
  Leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets to fine-tune and solve specific tasks, reducing the need for extensive computation and large datasets.
